# Brain Dojo

Brain Dojo is an IOS game written in SwiftUI. As my final project for Mobile Development 1.1 course at Make School, Brain Dojo tests players quick thinking and hend-eye-coordination. 

## Game Play

* Easy: White Cards
* Medium: White and Black Cards
* Hard: Green, Red, Black, and White Cards

Easy - Top card text must match the bottom card text color

Medium - Black cards = white card's opposite answer

Hard - Green cards = yes, red cards = no
